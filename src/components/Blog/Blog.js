            Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
            (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to
            indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own
            from which a browser should permit loading resources. CORS also
            relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a "preflight" request
            to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check
            that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight,
            the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers
            that will be used in the actual request.

            Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs,
            and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app. It
            supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular
            federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and
            more. Firebase is from google which is a trusted company for that
            reason we use firebase..

          How does the private route work?

            The private route component is similar to the public route, the only
            change is that redirect URL and authenticate condition. If the user
            is not authenticated he will be redirected to the login page and the
            user can only access the authenticated routes If he is authenticated
            (Logged in).

            Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low
            latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to
            serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or
            resources on waiting for I/O requests to return
